#Issues to be completed:

- [ ] List isn't resorting when overdue item is marked complete.
- [ ] Material stylesheet not not loading?
- [ ] Add datepicker validation to prevent selecting past dates.
- [ ] Editing should of course allow the user to change the due by date. However, I don't want to use the Material datepicker as there's too much overhead associated with it, so I've left it for now.
